    Only json files are allowed into the repository as a custom merge algorithm
    is used to resolve conflicts. Changes must be recorded into the repo file
    by file using the save_file and delete_file methods.

    The expected work-flow for concurrent usage of a repo is:

    * User A branches the repo to make his edits.
    * User B branches the repo to make his edits.
    * User A changes some files using save_file and delete_file.
    * User B changes some files using save_file and delete_file.
    * User A publishes his changes using publish_branch.
    * User A deletes his edit branch.
    * User B tries to publish using publish_branch. If the automatic merge
    is not able to resolve all conflicts, the publish is unsuccessful but
    intermediate merge files are be created containing meta-data to help
    resolve the pending conflicts.
        * User B resolves the pending conflicts.
        * User B publishes his changes using publish_branch.
        * User B deletes his edit branch.
